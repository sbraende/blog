            This project, completed in about two weeks of part-time work for HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania,
            features an interactive quiz with eight questions designed to be accessible,
            light-hearted, and fun!

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            I used ChatGPT to generate quiz questions about Norway, then carefully filtered and
            double-checked the answers for accuracy. The project had a quick turnaround, so I
            focused on creating a user-friendly and engaging experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>
            The coding process involved continuous improvement. While exploring VS Code, I
            discovered the
            <i>"Refactor"</i> button, which may have led to some over-abstraction in certain code
            sections. However, the core logic functions well and withstood testing. Ideally, the
            submit/review logic wouldn't be called from within another loop, but this is an area for
            future refinement.

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            I aimed for a minimalist and modern design. After exploring various sources, I drew
            inspiration primarily from
            <a href="https://brilliant.org/home/" target="_blank">Brilliant.org</a> and designs by
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/kpdesigns" target="_blank">Paresh Khatri</a> on Dribbble.
