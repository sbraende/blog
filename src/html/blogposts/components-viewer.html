            This project was a induvidual student assignment for HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania. It features a
            components viewer for organizing and showcasing reusable UI elements.

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            Part of the requirement was to create eight different components and display at least
            two states for them. Core functionality was the ability to click at different components
            to view them. In addition I added a <i>Add mode</i> for viewing components. In this mode
            you could click on mulitple components to view them.
          </p>

          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>
            Only vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript was allowed for this project. The CSS was split
            into multiple files for each component to make them more modular and easier to modify in
            the future. The Sidebar-buttons are dynamically created based on the components in the
            HTML.
