            This project is a responsive design clone of the popular 2048 game, originally created by Gabriele
            Cirulli. The goal was to replicate the visual style. This project was a induvidual student
            assignment for HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            With this project, I wanted to explore minimalist design principles while ensuring the game retained
            its iconic look. I studied the original 2048 interface and streamlined the layout for modern
            devices, keeping it engaging yet simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            The implementation involved creating a responsive grid system using vanilla HTML and CSS, ensuring
            the game adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile screens.
        </p>

        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
            The focus of this project was purely frontend design, so no game logic was implemented. Key
            highlights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Responsive grid layout using CSS Grid and media queries.</li>
            <li>- Custom styling for tiles, typography, and animations, replicating the original game's
                aesthetic.</li>
            <li>- Scalable design, making it easy to integrate functionality in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
            The design is rooted in simplicity and focus, with a color palette and typography inspired by the
            original game. The grid system ensures the layout remains balanced, and responsive adjustments
            ensure it works smoothly across all devices.
