            This project is a design clone of the Beats Solo 4 headphones product page. The aim was
            to replicate its clean and modern design, while focusing on responsiveness and user
            experience. This project was a induvidual student assignment for HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania.

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            The challenge for this project was to replicate the visual style and layout of the
            original Beats Solo 4 page while simplifying some elements to fit the scope of the
            assignment. The final version includes a main product page and a fictional checkout page
            to simulate a real-world e-commerce experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started by analyzing the structure of the original website, breaking it into key
            components, such as the product description, images, and pricing section. Once the
            design layout was planned, I implemented the project using vanilla HTML and CSS,
            ensuring every detail was polished.
          </p>

          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>
            The project primarily focused on static content, but included dynamic touches like hover
            effects and responsive scaling for different devices. I aimed for a modular CSS
            approach, with styles for grids, images, and typography being reusable across the pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website was thoroughly tested on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure it
            maintained a consistent look and feel, regardless of screen size.
          </p>
